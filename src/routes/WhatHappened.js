      <h2>What Happened</h2>

      <div className='content'>
        <p><em>2020 came, inflation hit, and I stopped feeling handsome.</em></p>

        <p>I learned that savings had become an increasing liability, and time and energy were becoming.</p>
          
        <p>That’s when Bitcoin came into my radar: a type of money owned by no one, backed by cryptography, and created by the community.</p>

        <p>Like many, I got into Bitcoin hoping for quick gains but stayed for the revolution.</p>

        <p>I have devoted my effort and experience as a Software Developer to create Bitcoin projects and help those around me embrace the power that Bitcoin can bring as an innovative, decentralized currency and an immutable asset.</p>
        <p>In the Information Era, coding and knowledge can be done by anyone from anywhere in the world, I am hoping that money can also follow along and let us achieve sovereignity.</p>

        {/* <p>Something was not right.</p>
        <p>I was constantly getting promoted, my job got busier and more stressful, and at some point we were not been able to save money any more even though we were making more than ever.</p>
        <p>We saved in different currencies as a “safety mechanism” and one of these currencies collapsed.</p>
        <p>We still felt safe since a big part of our savings were in US dollars (the global currency).</p>

        <p>Then 2021 came, and I stopped feeling handsome.</p>

        <p>I finally learned about inflation, bitcoin, fiat, and I had to deal with one of the hardest blows in life:</p>
        <p>A big portion of my hard-earned money was taken from me with the flick of a computer button and a printer. There was no way that money is coming back.</p>
        <p>Instead of the usual noise surrounding bitcoin, I finally went into the rabbit hole of bitcoin reading hard literature.</p>
        <p>My mission now is to do everything in my power as a Software Engineer to help others learn about the power of bitcoin and how we can finally achieve individual sovereignity.</p> */}
